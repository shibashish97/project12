# project12
3 way match
In this project our main aim was to compare the important features of purchase order, invoice and goods receipt image.
Before extracting text from image , we have performed different preprocessing technique on the image.
After text preprocessing we tried different OCR technique like Easyocr and Pytesseract ocr, we have also done a comparision between these two techniques.
Then we have used Easy ocr to extract text from the images in this project.
Then we have used Cosine similarity to check how much match we have between these three images.
All the images are also attached in this folder.
